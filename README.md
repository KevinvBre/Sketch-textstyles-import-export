# Textstyles import and export to JSON.
_This is a modified version of [this plugin Plugin (MIT)](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)!_

This plugin will export all text styles to a JSON file.
And this plugin will import that same JSON file to any other Sketch document. Thats all.

This is a modified version [this plugin Plugin (MIT)](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles) because that one stopped working and I needed the functionalities for a personal non work related project. I pretty much made this readme for the sole purpose of making that clear. I have no clue how to summit to another project and didn't feel like waiting on someone else.

##### This is whats changed:
- Support Sketch 52.2+
- New Sketch JavaScript API JSON parse
- New Sketch JavaScript API to force update new Textstyles
- Changed the shortcuts to stop interfering with system shortcuts.
- Added some GA
